## Highlights

-  - Command Palette: Fixed regression where it ran as admin instead of the current user when PowerToys was elevated; also resolved extension launch failures occurring only in admin mode.
-  - Workspaces: Fixed regression where command-line options support was expected but missing when launching classic Win32 apps (e.g. Edge, Chrome).
-  - Quick Accent: Fixed regression requiring activation key to be held simultaneously with the key during the "Input delays" period for accent selection; instead, only the key needs to be held after activation.
