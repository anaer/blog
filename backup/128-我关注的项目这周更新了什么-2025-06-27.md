# 1. [mihomo v1.19.11](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo/releases/tag/v1.19.11)  
A simple Python Pydantic model for Honkai: Star Rail parsed data from the Mihomo API.

<summary>ÂèòÊõ¥ËØ¥Êòé</summary>

## What's Changed
* 29a37f4f feat: all dns client support `disable-ipv4` and `disable-ipv6` params 
* 40587b62 feat: all dns client support `skip-cert-verify` params 
* 617fef84 feat: converter support anytls/socks/http  
* 85e6d25d feat: all dns client support `ecs` and `ecs-override` params 
* 9283cb0f feat: add `loopback-address` support for tun 
* Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6~v1.19.10:
> * For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to **workdir** (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the `SAFE_PATHS` environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
> * For security reasons, the "path" parameter of `/configs` in the restful api has been restricted, and its directory also needs to be in **workdir** or `SAFE_PATHS`.
> * In addition, support for specifying `routing-mark` and `interface-name` for `proxy-groups` has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in `proxies` directly.
> * Note: The **workdir** mentioned above is specified by the `-d` parameter when the program is started or the `CLASH_HOME_DIR` environment variable. If neither of the above is specified, the default is:
>   * on Unix systems, `$HOME/.config/mihomo`.
>   * on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%/.config/mihomo`.
> * The DNS resolution of the overall UDP part has been delayed to the connection initiation stage. It will be triggered only when the IP rule without no-resolve is matched during the rule matching process.
>   * For direct and wireguard outbound, the same logic as the TCP part will be followed, that is, when direct-nameserver (or DNS configured by wireguard) exists, the resolution result in the rule matching process will be discarded and the domain name will be re-resolved. This re-resolution logic is only effective for fakeip.
>   * For reject and DNS outbound, no resolution is required.
>   * For other outbound, resolution will still be performed when the UDP connection is initiated, and the domain name will not be sent directly to the remote server.

## BUG & Fix
* 31f0060b fix: chacha20 counter overflow 
* 32d447ce fix: convert https

* 5b975275 fix: incorrect checking of strings.Split return value 
* 6cfaf15c fix: missing error return 
* 71a87056 fix: remote dst parse 
* 8d7f947a fix: TypedValue.CompareAndSwap 
* ebf5918e fix: v2ray-plugin mux maybe not close underlay connection 

## Maintenance
* 01f8f2db chore: cleanup allocator code 
* 082bcec2 chore: apply find process mode in direct/global mode 
* 166392fe chore: sniffer replace domain only if domain is valid
