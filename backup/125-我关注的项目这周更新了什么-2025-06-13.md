## Upgrade Guide

### Docker Compose Deployments

1. Back up your customized docker-compose YAML file (optional)

   ```bash
   cd docker
   cp docker-compose.yaml docker-compose.yaml.$(date +%s).bak
   ```

2. Get the latest code from the main branch

   ```bash

## 📌 Summary

### 1. New Features & Improvements

- Parallel Node Support : Added parallel execution capabilities for workflow nodes.
- Dynamic UI Adjustments : Model selection dropdown now auto-adjusts width for better readability.
- Localization Support : Added translation files for `elsa-react` builds.
- Knowledge Retrieval Node Updates : Modified parameters for improved functionality.
- Read-Only Mode for Flow History : Enabled non-editable view for historical workflow inspection.

### 2. Critical Fixes & Stability

- Synchronous Serialization : Changed serialization to synchronous to prevent state corruption.
- File Extraction Clarity : Removed ambiguous extraction instructions from file nodes.
- Connector Sync Fix : Ensured connector name changes propagate to connected lines.
- Data Type Preservation : Fixed data type loss when switching variable modes.
- UI Optimization : Eliminated empty space in description columns.
- Reference Update Reliability : Forced updates on repeated selections in `JadeReferenceTreeSelect`.

### 3. Documentation & Maintenance

- Added README : Improved project documentation for better onboarding.

### 4. Knowledge Retrieval Node Refactor

- **Breaking Change**: Removed deprecated `userId` parameter in favor of `knowledgeConfigId` for improved traceability.
- Added `DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_NODE_KNOWLEDGE_CONFIG_ID` constant.
- Upgraded `UpdateGroupIdReducer` to `UpdateGroupIdAndConfigIdReducer` for synchronized updates of `groupId` and `knowledgeConfigId`.

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

- **Model Selection Dropdown**: Now dynamically adjusts width based on content length via `dropdownMatchSelectWidth={false}`.

### 6. GraphOperator Enhancements

- **Auto-Creation**: The `update` method now automatically initializes missing config paths.
- **Type Inference**: New `getTypeFromUpdates` utility infers data types (String, Array, Object, etc.) from input.

### **7. CI/CD Fixes**

- **Branch Matching**: Fixed regex to correctly target version branches (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`). Escaped decimal points in patterns.

## ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**

- **Migration Required**: Existing flows using`userId`must switch to`knowledgeConfigId`.
- **CI/CD Compliance**: Version branches must follow `elsa-{major}.{minor}.x` format (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`).
- **Serialization Behavior** : Now synchronous—ensure dependent code handles blocking operations.
- **File Extraction Node** : Extraction instructions removed; update any dependent configurations.
