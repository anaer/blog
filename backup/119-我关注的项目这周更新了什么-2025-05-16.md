## Highlights

 - We focused on greatly improving Command Palette's performance and fixing a large amount of bugs. Some new features we've added are:
 - Added the ability for Command Palette to search any file using a fallback command.
 - Added the ability to make the Command Palette global hotkey a low-level keyboard hook.
 - Added open URL fallback command for the WebSearch extension, enabling users to directly open URLs in the browser from Command Palette.
 - You can now define custom formats in the Date and Time plugins of PT Run and Command Palette. Thanks !

### Advanced Paste

 - Fixed an issue where Advanced Paste failed to create the OCR engine for certain English language tags (e.g., en-CA) by initializing the OCR engine with the user profile language. Thanks !

### Color Picker

 - Fixed an issue where a resource leak caused hangs or crashes by properly disposing of the Graphics object. Thanks !
 - Fixed an issue where Color Picker exited on Backspace keypress by ensuring it only closes when focused and aligning Escape/Backspace behavior. Thanks !
 - Added support for Oklab and Oklch color formats in Color Picker. Thanks !

### Command Not Found

 - Updated the WinGet Command Not Found script to only enable the experimental features if they actually exist.

### Command Palette

 - Updated bug template to include Command Palette module.
 - Fixed an issue where the toast window was not scaled for DPI, causing layout issues under display scaling.
 - Fixed an issue where Up/Down keyboard navigation didn't move selection when caret was at position 0, and add continuous navigation like PT Run v1. Thanks !
 - Updated the Time and Date extension code to simplify it and improve clarity.
 - Fixed an issue where capitalization in the command causes failure when trying to go to the mouse pointer, resolved by adjusting the command to lowercase.
 - Added open URL fallback command for the WebSearch extension, enabling users to directly open URLs in the browser from Command Palette. Thanks !
 - Added setting to enable/disable system tray icon in CmdPal and align terminology with Windows 11. Thanks !
 - Fixed an alias update issue by removing the old alias when a new one is set.
 - Resolved GitHub casing conflict by migrating Exts and exts into a new ext directory, ensuring consistent structure across platforms and preventing path fragmentation.
 - Fix an issue where the 'Create New Extension' command generated empty file names.
 - Added the ability to make the global hotkey a low-level keyboard hook.
 - Added support for JUMBO thumbnails, enabling access to high-resolution icons.
 - Fixed crashes when CmdPal auto-hid itself while an MSAL dialog was opened, by preventing CmdPal from hiding if it's disabled.
 - Added support for immediately selecting search text when a page is loaded.
 - Fixed a bug where extension settings pages failed to reload on reopen by updating the settings form when extension settings are saved.
 - Fixed an issue where the Command Palette failed to launch from the runner.
 - Refactored and ported the PowerToys Run v1 calculator logic into Command Palette, added settings support, and improved fallback behavior.
 - Re-added support for list item keyboard shortcuts.
 - Enhanced accessibility in Command Palette by adding proper labels, refining animations, improving localization, and fixed a11y related issues.
 - Ported custom format support to the Time and Date plugin, reordered and cleaned up settings, improved error messaging, and fixed edge-case crashes for more robust and user-friendly behavior. Thanks !
 - Added fallback item for system command.
 - Fixed a bug in Windows System Command where the key prompt incorrectly displayed "Empty" for the "Open Recycle Bin" action. Thanks !
 - Fixed an issue where the 'more commands' list showed commands that shouldn't be visible. Thanks !
 - Fixed an issue where the details view in Command Palette displayed an oversized icon and misaligned text, aligning it with Windows Search behavior.
 - Fixed a bug where empty screen content and command bar commands were cut off when using long labels, ensuring proper layout and visibility.
 - Improved CmdPal’s WinGet integration by fixing version display for installed packages, enabling updates with icons, and migrating the preview winget API to a stable version.
 - Fixed a bug where commands for ContentPage didn't update until after exit, by ensuring context menus are fully initialized when they change.
 - Added fallback support to the TimeDate extension, enabling direct date/time queries without pre-selecting the command.
 - Added import of Common.Dotnet.AotCompatibility.props across multiple CmdPal project files to enhance AOT compilation support.
 - Fixed a crash in CmdPal settings caused by a null HotKey when settings.json is missing or lacks a defined hotkey. Thanks !

 - Refactored CmdPal classes to improve JSON serialization and introduced new serialization contexts for better performance and maintainability.
 - Added support for ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation.
 - Added retry mechanism for CmdPal launch.
 - Removed some unused files from CmdPal.Common to simplify codebase and facilitate marking it as AoT-compatible.
 - Fixed a bug where a race condition in the update of SearchText caused the cursor in the input box to automatically jump to the end of the line, ensuring SearchText is only updated after it has actually been changed.
 - Added support for searching any file in fallback command.
 - Cleaned up AoT-related code to prevent duplicate operations during testing.
 - Reduced CmdPal load time by parallelizing extension startup and adding timeouts to prevent misbehaving extensions from blocking others.

 - Added support to unset the fallback command in CmdPal when no matching command is found, ensuring cleaner reload behavior.
 - Fixed a leak in the CmdPal extension template by addressing improper ComServer use.
 - Prevented CmdPal window from maximizing on title bar double-click to maintain intended window behavior. Thanks !
 - Fixed an issue where the Settings UI launched too small by making window dimensions DPI-aware and enforcing minimum width and height using WinUIEx.
 - Fixed white flash and one-time animation issues in CmdPal by cloaking the window instead of hiding it.
 - Fixed a bug where all extension settings were fetched on startup by lazy-loading extension settings, reducing initialization overhead.
 - Added support for protecting CmdPal from crashes on Adaptive Card parse failure.
 - Replaced shell:AppsFolder with URI activation in CmdPal to improve reliability.
 - Added ability to open CmdPal settings from PowerToys Settings.
 - Added ability for CmdPal to observe and dynamically update extension details by tracking property changes on the selected item.
 - Bumped the toolkit version used in the CmdPal extension template to 0.2.0.

### Image Resizer

 - Fixed an issue where deleting an Image Resizer preset removed the wrong preset.

### Keyboard Manager

 - Fixed an issue where a modifier key, when set without specifying left or right, would get stuck due to incorrect key handling, by tracking the pressed keys and sending the correct key accordingly. Thanks !

### PowerRename

 - Enhanced PowerRename's time formatting capabilities by adding 12-hour time format patterns with AM/PM support. Thanks !

### PowerToys Run

 - Added support for custom formats in the "Time and Date" plugin and improves error messages for invalid input formats. Thanks !
 - Fix two crashes: one for WFT on very early dates and another for calculating the week of the month on very late dates (e.g., 31.12.9999), and reorder UI settings. Thanks !
 - Fix an issue where capitalization in the command causes failure when trying to go to the mouse pointer, resolved by adjusting the command to lowercase.
 - Added version details to plugin error messages for 'Loading error' and 'Init error'. Thanks !
 - Enhanced result model by adding support for preventing usage-based ordering, giving plugin developers greater control over sorting behavior. Thanks  and !

### Quick Accent

 - Fixed an issue where Quick Accent did not work properly when using the on-screen keyboard. Thanks !

 - Enhanced Registry Preview to support pasting registry keys and values without manually writing the file header, and added a new button for resetting the app. Thanks !

### Settings

## 🌟 Overview

This release introduces enhancements to the knowledge retrieval node, UI improvements, and critical fixes for CI/CD and configuration handling.

## 🔍 What's Changed

### ✨ enhancement

* [elsa] enhance reference-type config protection  

### ✅ bugfix

* [elsa] Bug Fixes: Address UI Dropdown Resize, Knowledge Graph Updates, and GraphOperator.js Stability  
* [elsa] ci: fix version branch regex matching  
* [elsa] fix(GraphOperator): optimize single-key update handling  

**Full Changelog**: 

## 📌 Summary

### 1. Knowledge Retrieval Node Refactor

- **Breaking Change**: Removed deprecated `userId` parameter in favor of `knowledgeConfigId` for improved traceability.
- Added `DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_NODE_KNOWLEDGE_CONFIG_ID` constant.
- Upgraded `UpdateGroupIdReducer` to `UpdateGroupIdAndConfigIdReducer` for synchronized updates of `groupId` and `knowledgeConfigId`.

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

- **Model Selection Dropdown**: Now dynamically adjusts width based on content length via `dropdownMatchSelectWidth={false}`.

### 3. GraphOperator Enhancements

- **Auto-Creation**: The `update` method now automatically initializes missing config paths.
- **Type Inference**: New `getTypeFromUpdates` utility infers data types (String, Array, Object, etc.) from input.

### 4. CI/CD Fixes

- **Branch Matching**: Fixed regex to correctly target version branches (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`). Escaped decimal points in patterns.

### 5. Configuration Safeguards

- **Reference-Type Protection**: Stricter validation for `from: REFERENCE` configs (case-insensitive check).

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Migration Required**: Existing flows using`userId`must switch to`knowledgeConfigId`.
- **CI/CD Compliance**: Version branches must follow `elsa-{major}.{minor}.x` format (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`).

# 11. [duplicati v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/releases/tag/v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12)  
Store securely encrypted backups in the cloud!
<details>
<summary>变更说明</summary>

This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
#
# Major changes in this version
This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of `.dblock` files, if the data is still present locally.
This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual `.dblock` volumes can be fully recovered.
In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new `.dblock` files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.

The `purge-broken-files` can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
The `purge-broken-files` command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.

There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
The UI now supports a number of different languages.
#
## Database version upgrade to v16
The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
#
