## What's Changed
* The incompatible updates of the restful api not mentioned in the previous version of the changelog have been rolled back, solving the problem that the related gui cannot refresh the configuration
* Note that for security reasons, we are currently planning to restrict the "path" parameter of `/configs` in restful api in the next version, and its directory also needs to be in `SAFE_PATHS` or workdir. It is recommended that downstream clients adapt to this change in advance. (This change has been applied to alpha version 2116640)
* Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6:
> * For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the `SAFE_PATHS` environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
> * In addition, support for specifying `routing-mark` and `interface-name` for `proxy-groups` has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in `proxies` directly.

<summary>变更说明</summary>

This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
#
# Major changes in this version
This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of `.dblock` files, if the data is still present locally.
This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual `.dblock` volumes can be fully recovered.
In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new `.dblock` files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.

The `purge-broken-files` can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
The `purge-broken-files` command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.

There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
The UI now supports a number of different languages.
#
## Database version upgrade to v16
The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
#
