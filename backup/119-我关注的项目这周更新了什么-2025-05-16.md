# 6. [duplicati v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/releases/tag/v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12)  
Store securely encrypted backups in the cloud!
<details>
<summary>变更说明</summary>

This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
#
# Major changes in this version
This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of `.dblock` files, if the data is still present locally.
This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual `.dblock` volumes can be fully recovered.
In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new `.dblock` files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.

The `purge-broken-files` can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
The `purge-broken-files` command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.

There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
The UI now supports a number of different languages.
#
## Database version upgrade to v16
The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
#

- Support `CACHEDIR.TAG` as a default exclude file marker
- Improved `list-broken-files` to more accurately show contents, thanks

## elsa-v0.1.1
#
## Overview

This release introduces enhancements to the knowledge retrieval node, UI improvements, and critical fixes for CI/CD and configuration handling.
#
## What's Changed
#
### ✨ enhancement

* [elsa] enhance reference-type config protection  
#
### ✅ bugfix

* [elsa] Fix bugs of 0.1.x.  
* [elsa] ci: fix version branch regex matching  
* [elsa] fix(GraphOperator): optimize single-key update handling  

**Full Changelog**: 
#
## Summary
#
### 1. Knowledge Retrieval Node Refactor

- **Breaking Change**: Removed deprecated `userId` parameter in favor of `knowledgeConfigId` for improved traceability.
- Added `DEFAULT_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_NODE_KNOWLEDGE_CONFIG_ID` constant.
- Upgraded `UpdateGroupIdReducer` to `UpdateGroupIdAndConfigIdReducer` for synchronized updates of `groupId` and `knowledgeConfigId`.
#
### 2. UI/UX Improvements

- **Model Selection Dropdown**: Now dynamically adjusts width based on content length via `dropdownMatchSelectWidth={false}`.
#
### 3. GraphOperator Enhancements

- **Auto-Creation**: The `update` method now automatically initializes missing config paths.
- **Type Inference**: New `getTypeFromUpdates` utility infers data types (String, Array, Object, etc.) from input.
#
### 4. CI/CD Fixes

- **Branch Matching**: Fixed regex to correctly target version branches (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`). Escaped decimal points in patterns.
#
### 5. Configuration Safeguards

- **Reference-Type Protection**: Stricter validation for `from: REFERENCE` configs (case-insensitive check).
#
## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Migration Required**: Existing flows using`userId`must switch to`knowledgeConfigId`.
- **CI/CD Compliance**: Version branches must follow `elsa-{major}.{minor}.x` format (e.g., `elsa-0.1.x`).
