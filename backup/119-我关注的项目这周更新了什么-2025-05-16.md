<details>
<summary>变更说明</summary>

## What's Changed
* For security reasons, the "path" parameter of `/configs` in the restful api has been restricted, and its directory also needs to be in **workdir** or `SAFE_PATHS`.
* Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6:
> * For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to **workdir** (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the `SAFE_PATHS` environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
> * In addition, support for specifying `routing-mark` and `interface-name` for `proxy-groups` has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in `proxies` directly.
* Note: The **workdir** mentioned above is specified by the `-d` parameter when the program is started or the `CLASH_HOME_DIR` environment variable. If neither of the above is specified, the default is:
  * on Unix systems, `$HOME/.config/mihomo`.
  * on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%/.config/mihomo`.

## BUG & Fix
* 6e35cf93 fix: truncated UDP response in system dns  

## Maintenance
* 21166408 chore: the updateConfigs api also adds a check for `SAFE_PATHS` 
* 23e2d3a1 chore: rebuild provider load 
* 266fb038 chore: update dependencies 
* 76e9607f chore: move start healthcheck.process from New to Initial in provider avoid panic cause by build-in proxy have not set to tunnel

# 4. [duplicati v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12](https://github.com/duplicati/duplicati/releases/tag/v2.1.0.118_canary_2025-05-12)  
Store securely encrypted backups in the cloud!
<details>
<summary>变更说明</summary>

This release is a canary release intended to be used for testing.
#
# Major changes in this version
This version has a number of minor fixes and a major rewrite of the the "repair" command.
The logic for the "repair" command is that it should be possible to recover loss of `.dblock` files, if the data is still present locally.
This logic has been fixed in multiple ways and now also supports recovering data, even if no individual `.dblock` volumes can be fully recovered.
In this case, the repair will recreate as much data as possible in new `.dblock` files, and configure it so as many files as possible are available.

The `purge-broken-files` can be used after repair has failed to recover eveything, and will only purge the files that were lost.
The `purge-broken-files` command has also been updated to support using incorrect metadata, such that files are not purged if they are only missing metadata.

There are again numerous fixes to ngclient, including some faster browsing of restore contents, and better remote validation of folder contents.
The UI now supports a number of different languages.
#
## Database version upgrade to v16
The local database is again upgraded with two index changes for correctness and performance.
The bundled `Duplicati.CommandLine.DatabaseTool.exe` / `duplicati-database-tool` can downgrade databases.
Since the change is only index addition, there is no data loss on downgrades.
#
