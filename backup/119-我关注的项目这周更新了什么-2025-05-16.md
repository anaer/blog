## What's Changed
* The incompatible updates of the restful api not mentioned in the previous version of the changelog have been rolled back, solving the problem that the related gui cannot refresh the configuration
* Note that for security reasons, we are currently planning to restrict the "path" parameter of `/configs` in restful api in the next version, and its directory also needs to be in `SAFE_PATHS` or workdir. It is recommended that downstream clients adapt to this change in advance. (This change has been applied to alpha version 2116640)
* Other incompatible updates are the same as v1.19.6:
> * For security reasons, all paths appearing in the configuration file will be limited to workdir (regardless of whether they are relative or absolute). If there is a specific need, please specify additional safe paths by setting the `SAFE_PATHS` environment variable while ensuring safety. The syntax of this environment variable is the same as the PATH environment variable parsing rules of this operating system (i.e., semicolon-separated under Windows and colon-separated under other systems)
> * In addition, support for specifying `routing-mark` and `interface-name` for `proxy-groups` has been removed. Please specify the relevant parameters in `proxies` directly.
